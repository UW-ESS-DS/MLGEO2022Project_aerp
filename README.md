# MLGEO2022Project_aerp
Final project repository for MLGEO2022 (Anna Pearson)   
The initial data download is the detrended data coming from the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array [website](http://www.geodesy.org/data/bysite/) along with two sources with lists of station locations from the same site. It is stored in the stationDetrendedBasicDownload folder.     
To reproduce the analysis, begin by running readData.ipynb. This file does the initial pre-processing on the data. It has already been run, creating the data found in the stations folder as well as the lonLat and names textfiles. Then, run the rest of the analysis by running analysisWorkflow.ipynb. The notebook is set up to run over a full 10 year subset of the geodetic data, from 2010 to 2020. This process takes a very long time to run, so a smaller subset of the data could be chosen.
