# MLGEO2022Project_aerp
Final project repository for MLGEO2022 (Anna Pearson)   
The initial download of data comes from the detrended data here (http://www.geodesy.org/data/bysite/).     
To run the project, begin by running readData.ipynb--- this file converts the data in the stationDetrendedBasicDownload folder into the (already created) data in the stations folder.    
Then, run the analysis by running analysisWorkflow.ipynb.
